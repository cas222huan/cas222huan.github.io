Nice to meet you :-)

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the School of Geodesy and Geomatics (SGG), Wuhan University in 2021.

Funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC), I am taking part in a joint development Ph.D. project in the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) from 2024 to 2026.

Under the supervision of [Dr. Bo-Hui Tang](https://igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrck/kygg/xxxt/201105/t20110531_3146304.html) and [Dr. Tian Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E0dkUncAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), my primary research focuses on combining <font color='red'>remote sensing physics</font> with <font color='red'>machine learning</font> to retrieve <font color='blue'>land surface biophysical parameters</font>, such as land surface temperature (LST) and surface radiation budget (SRB).

If you are interested in my work or have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email!
